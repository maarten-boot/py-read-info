# py-read-info
read info type config files

## WORK IN PROGRESS

the tokenizer works, itterpreter comes next
data will be stored in nested dicts unless we have fully duplicate keys then keys/values will be arrays

## INFO files

info files are described in
[info_parser](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/doc/html/property_tree/parsers.html#property_tree.parsers.info_parser)
and look similar to config files used in nginx and dovecot.
